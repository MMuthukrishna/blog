### [GnuCash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gnucash.android&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

GnuCash is the best expense tracking android app in my opinion, it even lets you automatically export your transactions to Dropbox, which allows you write an alert microservice to fetch the GnuCash Export Book from Dropbox and send an alert when you exceed the set budget for a month or build your own Personal Recon System (I will write another detailed article about the endless possibilities). The only downside is that you're expected to log every single transaction manually (Been doing this for over 2 years now).

### [Detexify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=website.marty.detexify&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

To find the LaTeX symbol by drawing it. Really useful if you use LaTeX a lot.

### [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en&gl=US)

Nice app to track and stick to habits.

### [Lithium: EPUB Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

Really good E-Book reader.

### [Greenify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify&hl=en)

Every single android app that runs in the background when it doesn't need to is a parasite that's utilizing your Compute, Storage, Power and Network bandwidth. Kill it with Greenify. (The awful state of android apps makes me consider switching to Pinephone).

### [Movie DB](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.notabug.lifeuser.moviedb/)

To track the movies and TV shows you watch and see the latest movies and TV shows available. It even lets you export your data in a single JSON file with which you can do analysis. (I figured out I have a bias towards Animation movies from this).

### [Probability Math Puzzles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atorch.statspuzzles&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

If you like solving Probability Puzzles to kill time.

### [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

To do Jugaad Automation like
- Turning of Wifi when display is off
- Automatically killing specific apps with Greenify Periodically.
- Play the "[You've Got Mail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFBLiHpkcOk)" sound every time you receive an E-Mail.

### [Tasks](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.tasks/)

Really great FOSS app to note down tasks and reminders.
